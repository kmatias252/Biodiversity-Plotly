# Biodiversity-Plotly

## Overview of Biodiversity Plotly:

The purpose of this project is to assist Roza by creating a dashboard that includes demographic information and visualizations for the bacterial data for each volunteer. The visualizations included in this analysis are 1) a bar chart which identifies the top 10 bacteria cultures found in each volunteer, 2) a bubble chart which displays the bacteria cultures per sample from the volunteers and 3) a gauge chart which displays belly button washing frequency in terms of scrubs per week. If "Improbable Beef" identifies a bacteria species to manufacture synthetic beef, the analysis will help Roza determine if there is a volunteer with matching bacteria species.  

## Results:

* Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart 
* Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart 
* Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
* Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard
